# TensorFlow/Keras

## Overview

This project aims to predict the Pawpularity scores of pet images by leveraging both metadata and image features. The analysis includes comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the development of a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras. The dataset is sourced from the PetFinder.my Pawpularity Contest, where my project achieved a leaderboard ranking of 3,247 out of 14,192 participants.

## Features

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Examination of metadata to identify trends and correlations.
- Visualization of data distributions and relationships between features and Pawpularity scores.

### Deep Learning Model
- Development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras to predict Pawpularity scores.
- Integration of both metadata and image features to enhance predictive performance.

### Performance Evaluation
- Assessment of the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to evaluate accuracy and goodness of fit.
